My technical tasks consisted in designing, testing and implementing DSP pipelines in the system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vibratio</title><link>https://javiergarciaserrano.com/projects/vibratio/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 09:53:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://javiergarciaserrano.com/projects/vibratio/</guid><description>&lt;p>Vibratio is a startup project that consists on making a real-time reverb cancelling system for speakers. My work started with the atchitecture conception, and ended with an embedded system that can play aptX audio and run configurable DSP pipelines in real time by using a phone app. For this task an STM32H7 and Qualcomm QCC5125 were used. The DSP capabilities in ARM processors were key to achieve an efficient convolution algotihm.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
