[{"categories":null,"contents":"This article is a guide to help you create your own version of the site using Adritian. It will cover the main steps to get started with the theme, and how to customize it to your needs.\nCreating a site This theme is for the content management system Hugo, so that will be a pre-requirement. Make sure that you install the extended version of Hugo, as the theme uses SCSS for styling, as well as image optimization.\nA very good place to start is the Quick start guide: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/\n💡Tip:_ keep your repository clean and tidy by creating a relevant .gitignore file since the beginning:\n# Generated files by hugo\r/public/\r/resources/_gen/\r/assets/jsconfig.json\rhugo_stats.json\r# Executable may be added to repository\rhugo.exe\rhugo.darwin\rhugo.linux\r# Temporary lock file while building\r/.hugo_build.lock Adding the theme Once you have a site created, you can add the theme to your site by following the instructions in the README. While there are multiple ways to add the theme, the recommended way is to use the Hugo Modules, the ones listed here.\nInstructions to setup the theme as a hugo module\rCreate a new Hugo site (this will create a new folder): hugo new site \u0026lt;your website's name\u0026gt; Enter the newly created folder: cd \u0026lt;your website's name\u0026gt;/ Initialize the Hugo Module system in your site if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already: hugo mod init github.com/username/your-site (you don\u0026rsquo;t need to host your website on GitHub, you can add anything as a name) Replace the contents of your

simple, summary This configuration allows you to have a base to edit and adapt to your site, and see the available functionalities. Make sure to edit baseURL, title and description. You can edit the header links, as well as the languages to your needs.\nGet the module: hugo mod get -u Execute hugo mod npm pack - this will generate a package.json file in the root folder of your site, with the dependencies for the theme. Execute npm install - this will install the dependencies for the theme (including bootstrap) (Optional, to override the defaults) Create a file data/homepage.yml with the contents of the exampleSite/data/homepage.yml file, and customize to your needs. Start Hugo with hugo server\u0026hellip; 🎉 The theme is alive on http://localhost:1313/ (if everything went well) Editing the theme content Currently the theme content is spread over multiple folders and files. We are working on simplifying this - but for now this guide should help you get started.\nSome of the key files are:\nconfig.toml: Main configuration for your Hugo site. Here you can set the site title, description, and theme specific settings such as:\nmenu structure (footer and header) analytics (vercel, google) blog settings (layout, sidebar contents, etc) As well as some required settings for the theme to work properly (module.mounts, params.plugins.css) data/homepage.yml: homepage structure, content and sections - including social links, and the hero section.\nassets/: Where you can store static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files (you can add custom CSS and JS files with the params.plugins.css in config.toml).\ncontent/: This is where your content files will live. The theme-specific ones are:\ncontent/blog/: For blog posts. content/portfolio/: For portfolio items. content/project/: For projects. content/testimonial/: For testimonials. content/education/: For education items. content/experience/: For experience items. content/client-and-work/: For client and work items. Customizing the theme Hugo allows you to customize the theme in many ways. You can override the theme\u0026rsquo;s layouts, styles, and content. For that, you just need to locate the file you would like to change, copy it to your site\u0026rsquo;s corresponding folder (layouts, assets, \u0026hellip;), and edit it.\nNote: if you do this you will not benefit from theme updates, and that could lead to bugs. You can keep an eye on the UPGRADING.md file.\nImproving the theme Maybe some of the customizations you do are worth a share. If you think that your changes could be useful for others, feel free to open a pull request in the GitHub repository - collaborations are very welcome, especially if the contributions come from real-world use cases.\nPublishing the site Once you have your site ready, you can publish it to the web. There are many ways to do this, but the recommended one is to use a service like Vercel or Github Pages. Both services offer free hosting for static sites, and they can be connected to your GitHub repository for automatic deployments.\nFor that, you will need to have a CI/CD action that builds your site and deploys it to the service. You can find an example of a GitHub action in the demo site repository: https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/hugo.yml\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/getting-started/","tags":["adritian","guide"],"title":"Create your own version of the site"},{"categories":null,"contents":"How to Add Custom Icons to the Adritian Theme Table of Contents Prerequisites Overview Step 1: Export Current Configuration Step 2: Import Configuration to Fontello Step 3: Add New Icons Step 4: Download Updated Font Step 5 (option 1): Update Theme Files Manually Step 5 (option 2): Update Theme Files with npm script Step 6: Using the New Icon Example Usage Troubleshooting Icons Not Displaying Icons Show as Squares Build Errors Best Practices Additional Resources This guide will walk you through adding custom icons to your Adritian Hugo theme. Whether you need new social media icons, brand logos, or custom symbols, follow these steps to integrate them seamlessly.\nPrerequisites Before you begin, make sure you have:\nAccess to your Hugo site\u0026rsquo;s source files Basic understanding of file management A web browser to access Fontello Overview The Adritian theme uses a custom icon font generated with Fontello. This is a fork of the original fontello, with additional font options.\nTo add new icons, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to:\nExport the current icon configuration Add new icons using Fontello Download and integrate the updated font files Update your site configuration Step 1: Export Current Configuration Navigate to your theme\u0026rsquo;s font directory: static/fonts/ Locate the config.json file (see the downstream version) Keep this file ready - you\u0026rsquo;ll upload it to Fontello Step 2: Import Configuration to Fontello Go to Fontello Click the import button (wrench icon) Upload your config.json file Fontello will load your current icon set Step 3: Add New Icons Browse available icons in Fontello\u0026rsquo;s library Click on icons you want to add (they\u0026rsquo;ll be highlighted) Configure icon names by clicking the pencil icon next to each selected icon Set icon codes if needed (Fontello usually assigns these automatically) Step 4: Download Updated Font Click the Download webfont button in Fontello Save the generated ZIP file to your computer Extract the ZIP file contents Step 5 (option 1): Update Theme Files Manually Copy font files from the downloaded ZIP to static/fonts/:\nCopy .woff, .woff2, .ttf, and .eot files Update CSS file:\nOpen the CSS file from the ZIP Important: Replace all instances of /font with /fonts Copy the updated CSS to your theme\u0026rsquo;s CSS file Replace config.json:\nCopy the new config.json from the ZIP to static/fonts/ Step 5 (option 2): Update Theme Files with npm script You can use the theme helper (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zetxek/adritian-theme-helper) to update the theme files.\nYou can read the theme helper font script here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zetxek/adritian-theme-helper#user-content-update-font-script\nWith the following command you can update the theme files with the new icons automatically:\nts-node scripts/update-font.ts \u0026lt;source\u0026gt; \u0026lt;destination\u0026gt; Step 6: Using the New Icon Reference your new icons in your content, as for the pre-provided icons.\nExample Usage \u0026lt;!-- In your templates --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;i class=\u0026#34;icon-your-new-icon-name\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- In markdown with HTML --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;i class=\u0026#34;icon-your-new-icon-name\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; Custom Icon Text \u0026lt;!-- In a markdown file --\u0026gt; { {\u0026lt; link icon=\u0026#34;icon-your-new-icon-name\u0026#34; url=\u0026#34;https://example.com\u0026#34; \u0026gt;} } Note: for the markdown file, no spaces between the curly braces - added so it gets displayed here properly.\nTroubleshooting Icons Not Displaying Check file paths: Ensure fonts are in static/fonts/ Verify CSS paths: Make sure /font is changed to /fonts Clear browser cache: Force refresh with Ctrl+F5 (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) Icons Show as Squares Font files missing: Verify all font files were copied correctly CSS not loaded: Check that your CSS includes the new icon definitions Build Errors Invalid CSS: Check for syntax errors in your CSS file Missing files: Ensure all required font files are present Best Practices Keep backups: Save your old config.json before making changes Test locally: Always test icon changes on your local development site first Consistent naming: Use clear, descriptive names for your custom icons Optimize selection: Only include icons you actually need to keep font file sizes small Do not modify the theme, override the files in your own project: Instead of modifying the theme, override the files in your own site project. That will ensure you can update the theme without losing your changes. If your icon choice is a popular one, consider contributing it to the theme: If you think your icon choice is a popular one, consider contributing it to the theme. That will help other users and make the theme more complete. Additional Resources Fontello Documentation Adritian Theme Icons - View all available icons Need help?

Execute npm install - this will install the dependencies for the theme (including bootstrap) (Optional, to override the defaults) Create a file data/homepage.yml with the contents of the exampleSite/data/homepage.yml file, and customize to your needs (note: this file is not included in your theme if you use hugo modules, download it manually from the repository) Traditional Installation (as git submodule) If you prefer not to use Hugo Modules, you can still install the theme as a git submodule. The guide is very similar to official \u0026ldquo;Quick Start\u0026rdquo;, just changing the theme URL in the git submodule add command:\nOld instructions for git submodules\rCreate a new Hugo site (this will create a new folder): hugo new site \u0026lt;your website's name\u0026gt;\nEnter the newly created folder: cd \u0026lt;your website's name\u0026gt;/\nInitialize hugo modules: hugo mod init github.com/\u0026lt;your_user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;your_project\u0026gt;\nInstall PostCSS: execute npm i -D postcss postcss-cli autoprefixer from the top-level site folder [check Hugo\u0026rsquo;s official docs].\nAdd adritian-free-hugo-theme as a module dependency, by adding\n[module]\r[[module.imports]]\rpath = \u0026#39;github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme\u0026#39; To your hugo.toml file, and executing hugo mod get -u\nReplace the hugo.toml file in the project\u0026rsquo;s root directory with the contents of themes/adritian-free-hugo-theme/exampleSite/config.toml. If you are using the git submodules, you can execute cp themes/adritian-free-hugo-theme/exampleSite/hugo.toml hugo.toml (executed from the website root folder), otherwise just copy and paste the contents.\nCreate the file data/homepage.yml, with the initial contents of the exampleSite/data/homepage.yml. This will serve as your starting point to customize your home content ✍️\nStart Hugo with hugo server -D\n🎉 The theme is alive on http://localhost:1313/\nOptional, and only for git submodule or when you download the whole repo: if you want to preview the theme with the example content before deciding if it\u0026rsquo;s what you are looking for, you can run the theme with the example content:\ncd themes/adritian-free-hugo-theme/exampleSite\rhugo server --themesDir ../.. Note: The exampleSite is not downloaded when installing the Hugo module.
