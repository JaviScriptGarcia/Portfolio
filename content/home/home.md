    title="What I do"
    content="I work as a freelance for companies and teams of all sizes. I can dive into any project and technology, and play different roles in a team. My years enrolled in different tasks and companies turned me into a highly technical and creative problem-solver. <br/><br/>I am passionate on what I do, and always stay commited with my given purpose. I will always look further ahead to ease the work of my colleagues and leaders, and make communication a priority for success.<br/><br/>My experience was earned working on many different projects, as well as studying powerful technologies, both during my academic and working years. I am a naturally-curious person, and I am always excited to learn more.<br/><br/>I am happy to share with you a deeper insight of my background.
