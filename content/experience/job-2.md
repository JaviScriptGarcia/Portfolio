## Signal Processing and R&D Engineer

During my time at Zigor I had an important role as the main signal processing engineer and PCB designer in the development of various power converters and power electronic devices.

I was in charge of the hardware development of a power supply with over 10 kV insulation barriers, where I designed essential parts like analog and EMI filters, and implemented digital filters in the microcontroller. I also led the whole PCB design validation and testing using Altium.

I also took part in other power converter projects, where I designed PCBs for high-speed signals, did hardware simulations, designed analog and combinational circuits, and did experimental research.
