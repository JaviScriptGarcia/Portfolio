## R&D Scholarship, Embedded Software

As a Junior Intern at the Universitat Politècnica de València, I had the chance to work on different projects that helped me build my technical and professional skills. Working with experienced engineers and PhDs, I contributed to the development of research devices.

During the internship, I was asked to write firmware in C for communicating several Texas Instruments microcontrollers over a single serial line. I also did extensive research on minimizing transistor losses in power converters and worked on industrial Windows software development.

I was also involved in firmware tasks for ESP32 and TI devices, mostly communicating devices using I2C, MODBUS TCP/IP, RS485, and UART.
