## Firmware Engineer

As a Firmware Engineer, I worked with STM32 and ESP32 to develop and maintain firmware for consumer electronics. Part of my job was to develop a system for mass-programming custom PCBs.

All the projects I worked on focused on cost optimization, so the microcontrollers had very limited resources. For that reason, I used low-level APIs and bare-metal programming for STM32, and FreeRTOS for ESP32.
