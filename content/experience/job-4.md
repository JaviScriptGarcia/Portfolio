## My work as a freelance

As a freelancer, I worked on two major projects.

Project #1: an innovative real-time reverb-canceling embedded system for speaker correction using deep learning and reinforcement learning. In this project I did the full system design on STM32H7, from concept to prototype. It included a Qualcomm QCC chip for top-quality Bluetooth audio. Most development focused on building fast DSP algorithms for the ARM microcontroller and pushing performance to the limit for large convolutions. At the same time, I programmed a CNN in Python with TensorFlow for other tasks.

Project #2: Development of a wireless sensing system using AI and RF. This project is confidential under NDA protection.
